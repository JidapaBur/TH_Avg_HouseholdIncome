## 1. Introduction

Thailand‚Äôs economic landscape has undergone significant changes between 2011 and 2023, reflecting shifts in household income, expenses, and overall GDP. Understanding these trends is crucial for assessing the financial well-being of Thai households and the broader economic stability of the country.

This study explores the **trend analysis** of household average monthly income and expenses over the years, examining how these factors have evolved relative to GDP. **The ratio of income and expenses to GDP** provides insights into the economic balance and sustainability of household finances. Furthermore, a **correlation analysis** between income, expenses, and GDP helps identify the interdependence of these variables. Lastly, the study delves into **purchasing power**, assessing whether household earnings have kept pace with inflation and economic growth.

By analyzing data at two-year intervals from 2011 to 2023, this research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Thailand‚Äôs household economic trends, highlighting key patterns, disparities, and potential implications for future economic.


## 2. Trend Analysis

### 2.1 Comparing Household Income with GDP per Household

- Formula: GDP per Capita

       GDP per Capita per year =  Total GDP per year
                                  ___________________
                                     Population
  
       GDP per Capita per month =  GDP per Capita per year
                                  ________________________
                                            12

- Formula: GDP per Household
  
       GDP per Household =      GDP per Capita per month
                           _______________________________
                                Average Household size

Figure 1: Comparing Household Income with GDP per Household 
</p>


> [!NOTE]
> Calculate GDP per Household: Given assumption of Population = 66 Million people, Average Household size = 2.5 people


The average household income is LOWER THAN the GDP per household.
This indicates that Thai household earn less than the expected GDP share per household.
The disparity suggests income inequality, where GDP growth is driven by business and exports rather than increased earnings for the general population.

### 2.2 Comparing Household Expenses with Income

Figure 2.1: Comparing Household Expenses with Income
</p>



Household Expenses account for 75% of Income, leaving minimal savings.

### 2.3 The Gap between Income and Expenses

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/JidapaBur/TH_Avg_HouseholdIncome/blob/main/images/2.3%20The%20Gap%20between%20Income%20and%20Expenses.png">
Figure 3: The Gap between Income and Expenses
</p>

Although income has increased, expenses have also risen. The gap between income and expenses has shown a declining trend each year.

## 3. The Ratio of Income-Expense to GDP

- Formula: the Ratio of Income-Expense to GDP

        Average Income Ratio to GDP =  Average Monthly Income x 12
                                      ____________________________
                                         GDP per Household

        Average Expense Ratio to GDP = Average Monthly Expenses x 12
                                      ______________________________
                                         GDP per Household

- If the expense ratio is higher than the income ratio, it may reflect an increase in household debt.

Figure 4: The Ratio of Income-Expense to GDP
</p>

Although the proportion of expenses to GDP is lower than the proportion of income to GDP, the gap between income and expenses has continued to narrow in recent years.

## 4. Correlation Analysis

  <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/JidapaBur/TH_Avg_HouseholdIncome/blob/main/images/4.%20Correlation%20Analysis.png">
Figure 5: Correlation Analysis
</p>


Relationship Correlation Coefficient Interpretation

Income ‚Üî Expenses 0.99 ‚úÖ Very strong positive correlation

Income ‚Üî GDP 0.85 ‚úÖ Strong positive correlation

Expenses ‚Üî GDP 0.89 ‚úÖ Strong positive correlation

Income and expenses tend to move together almost all the time. Both income and expenses show a positive correlation with the country's GDP.

## 5. Purchasing Power

       Purchasing Power =   Income 
                           _________
                            Expenses

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/JidapaBur/TH_Avg_HouseholdIncome/blob/main/images/5.%20Purchasing%20Power.png">
Figure 6: Purchasing Power
</p>


A higher value indicates more money remaining after expenses, reflecting greater purchasing power.

üìâ Observed Trends:

2011‚Äì2013: Purchasing power remained above 1.3, indicating relatively strong consumer capacity.

2015‚Äì2023: A steady decline in purchasing power was observed.

Most recent year (2023): Purchasing power dropped to approximately 1.23, suggesting that expenses are now closer to income levels.

üìù Policy Implications:

The rising cost of living may be eroding the purchasing power of Thai households.

Income growth is not keeping pace with the increase in expenses, posing challenges to household financial stability.

## 7. Conclusion

An analysis of historical income and expenditure data reveals a consistent year-on-year increase in both income and expenses among the Thai population. However, the rate of expenditure growth has outpaced that of income, resulting in reduced savings and an increased likelihood of household debt. This trend suggests that many individuals are compelled to borrow due to financial necessities exceeding their income.

Further analysis across multiple economic dimensions‚Äîsuch as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation rate, and minimum wage‚Äîindicates that all these factors contribute to the rising cost of living. Among them, the most significant impact stems from the rising cost of living, which has increased at a rate higher than inflation.

This surge in the cost of living is largely attributed to rising production and service costs, especially in essential utilities such as fuel and electricity. These energy costs are noticeably higher in Thailand compared to neighboring countries in the same region
