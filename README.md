## 1. Introduction
We present the relationship between average monthly income, expenses, and GDP in Thailand (2011-2023) to better understand how economic growth affects peopleâ€™s earnings and spending habits. 
By analyzing data, we can see whether higher GDP leads to higher income and expenses or if other factors influence financial stability.
We will use correlation analysis to measure how strongly these factors are connected. This will help identify trends in household spending, income growth, and economic well-being.
The results of this study can provide useful insights for policymakers, businesses, and individuals to make informed financial and economic decisions.

### 2.1 Comparing Household Income with GDP per Household

- Formula: GDP per Capita

       GDP per Capita per year =  Total GDP per year
                                  ___________________
                                     Population
  
       GDP per Capita per month =  GDP per Capita per year
                                  ________________________
                                            12

- Formula: GDP per Household
  
       GDP per Household =      GDP per Capita per month
                           _______________________________
                                Average Household size

> [!NOTE]
> Calculate GDP per Household: Given assumption of Population = 66 Million people, Average Household size = 2.5 people


The average household income is LOWER THAN the GDP per household.
This indicates that Thai household earn less than the expected GDP share per household.
The disparity suggests income inequality, where GDP growth is driven by business and exports rather than increased earnings for the general population.

Figure 3: The Gap between Income and Expenses
</p>

Although income has increased, expenses have also risen. The gap between income and expenses has shown a declining trend each year.

## 3. The Ratio of Income-Expense to GDP

- Formula: the Ratio of Income-Expense to GDP

        Average Income Ratio to GDP =  Average Monthly Income x 12
                                      ____________________________
                                         GDP per Household

        Average Expense Ratio to GDP = Average Monthly Expenses x 12
                                      ______________________________
                                         GDP per Household

- If the expense ratio is higher than the income ratio, it may reflect an increase in household debt.

Figure 4: The Ratio of Income-Expense to GDP
</p>

Although the proportion of expenses to GDP is lower than the proportion of income to GDP, the gap between income and expenses has continued to narrow in recent years.
