## 1. Introduction

Thailand’s economic landscape has undergone significant changes between 2011 and 2023, reflecting shifts in household income, expenses, and overall GDP. Understanding these trends is crucial for assessing the financial well-being of Thai households and the broader economic stability of the country.

This study explores the **trend analysis** of household average monthly income and expenses over the years, examining how these factors have evolved relative to GDP. **The ratio of income and expenses to GDP** provides insights into the economic balance and sustainability of household finances. Furthermore, a **correlation analysis** between income, expenses, and GDP helps identify the interdependence of these variables. Lastly, the study delves into **purchasing power**, assessing whether household earnings have kept pace with inflation and economic growth.

By analyzing data at two-year intervals from 2011 to 2023, this research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Thailand’s household economic trends, highlighting key patterns, disparities, and potential implications for future economic.


## 2. Trend Analysis

### 2.1 Comparing Household Income with GDP per Household

- Formula: GDP per Capita

       GDP per Capita per year =  Total GDP per year
                                  ___________________
                                     Population
  
       GDP per Capita per month =  GDP per Capita per year
                                  ________________________
                                            12

- Formula: GDP per Household
  
       GDP per Household =      GDP per Capita per month
                           _______________________________
                                Average Household size

> [!NOTE]
> Calculate GDP per Household: Given assumption of Population = 66 Million people, Average Household size = 2.5 people


The average household income is LOWER THAN the GDP per household.
This indicates that Thai household earn less than the expected GDP share per household.
The disparity suggests income inequality, where GDP growth is driven by business and exports rather than increased earnings for the general population.

</p>



Household Expenses account for 75% of Income, leaving minimal savings.

### 2.3 The Gap between Income and Expenses

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/JidapaBur/TH_Avg_HouseholdIncome/blob/main/images/2.3%20The%20Gap%20between%20Income%20and%20Expenses.png">
Figure 3: The Gap between Income and Expenses
</p>

Although income has increased, expenses have also risen. The gap between income and expenses has shown a declining trend each year.

## 3. The Ratio of Income-Expense to GDP

- Formula: the Ratio of Income-Expense to GDP

        Average Income Ratio to GDP =  Average Monthly Income x 12
                                      ____________________________
                                         GDP per Household

        Average Expense Ratio to GDP = Average Monthly Expenses x 12
                                      ______________________________
                                         GDP per Household

- If the expense ratio is higher than the income ratio, it may reflect an increase in household debt.

Figure 4: The Ratio of Income-Expense to GDP

Although the proportion of expenses to GDP is lower than the proportion of income to GDP, the gap between income and expenses has continued to narrow in recent years.
