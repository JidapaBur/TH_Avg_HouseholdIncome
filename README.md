## 1. Introduction
We present the relationship between average monthly income, expenses, and GDP in Thailand (2011-2023) to better understand how economic growth affects people’s earnings and spending habits. 
By analyzing data, we can see whether higher GDP leads to higher income and expenses or if other factors influence financial stability.
We will use correlation analysis to measure how strongly these factors are connected. This will help identify trends in household spending, income growth, and economic well-being.
The results of this study can provide useful insights for policymakers, businesses, and individuals to make informed financial and economic decisions.

## 3. Calculate the Ratio of Income-Expenses to GDP

- Formula

        Average Income Ratio to GDP =  Average Monthly Income x 12
                                    ----------------------------
                                         GDP per Capita

        Average Expense Ratio to GDP = Average Monthly Expenses x 12
                                    ----------------------------
                                         GDP per Capita

- If the expense ratio is higher than the income ratio, it may reflect an increase in household debt.
